//For help
docker run --help

//clear screen

// To see version 
docker -v
docker --version

//Pull image
docker pull image_name

//To see total images available in system
docker images

//To download different different version of same software use (colon and version number image_name example--- (openjdk:18))
docker pull openjdk:18

//To serach docker images which all are available through commands or (we can search it online on (dockerhub))
docker search image_name

//To run docker images but it will not run in background it will start the image and stop it
docker run image_name_OR_Id

//To see which all docker's containers are running stage
docker ps

//To see all container's that all runned
docker ps -a

//To run docker image, provide container_name by yourself and in last how to use it in detach mode by using (-d)
//by this detach we will get a big ID but still it will run and stop the image
docker run --name container_name_of_our_wish -d image_name_OR_Id

//To run image and access it we have to run it INTERACTIVE mode by using shortcut (-it) & now it will not stop
 docker run --name container_name_of_our_wish -it -d image_name_OR_Id

//To go inside the container so that we can use it for that we need to go in EXECUTE mode by using(exec)
//COMMAND_name ---- we can get this name after running the image
docker exec -it container_name_OR_Id_(DON"T_USE_IMAGE_ID) COMMAND_name

//To get out of EXECUTE mode every images have different commands
example: python---> exit()
         Java----->/exit
to get out of any server like nginx or appache---->exit

//To stop container
docker stop container_name_OR_Id

//To remove container from history(docker ps -a) use shortcut of REMOVE(rm)
docker rm container_name_OR_Id( & here we can use starting value of ID after that also it will work docker it identify itself)

//To remove images from docker use shortcut of REMOVEIMAGE(rmi)
docker rmi image_name(ONLY IMAGE NAME NOT BY ID)

//To run images like MYSQL we need to set ENIVRONMENT(-e) like user_name_&_password 
//here mysql:tag---> tag means version of mysql you want if you have more than one software's
docker run --name container_name_of_our_wish -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password_of_mysql -d mysql:tag(here mysql is image_name)
//To execute it 
docker exec -it container_name_OR_Id bash

//To see all history of any container use (inspect)
docker inspect container_name_OR_Id
